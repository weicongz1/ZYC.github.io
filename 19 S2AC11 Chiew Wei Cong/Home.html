            <p>Jahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy (January 23, 1998 ~ June 18, 2018), known professionally as XXXTentacion (often stylized as XXXTENTACION) and commonly referred to as simply X, was an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. Though a controversial figure due to his widely publicized legal troubles, XXXTentacion gained a cult following among his young fanbase during his short career with his depression- and alienation-themed music. Critics and fans often credit him for his musical versatility, with his music exploring emo, drill, trap, lo-fi, indie rock, nu metal, hip hop, R&B, and punk rock. He is considered to be a leading figure in the emo rap and SoundCloud rap genres which garnered mainstream attention during the mid-to-late 2010s, and is the bestselling emo rapper of all time.</p>
